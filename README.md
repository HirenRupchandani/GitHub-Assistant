To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Run Locally

### Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-assistant.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd git-assistant
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the Streamlit server

```bash
  streamlit run github_chat.py
```

NOTE: Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEy` is active when you run the chat.py file. As of May 2024, you need to pay atleast 5 USD to use that API but I guess it is worth it because the API calls are very very cheap.
